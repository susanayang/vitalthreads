In this game, you restore harmony by realigning energetic pathways, acting as a healer navigating the body's intricate network of qi. Patients appear on left side of the screen — represented with expressive Live2D avatars — and react as you unblock the flow within their nerve systems by connecting puzzle pieces.

- Puzzle mechanics involving piece placement, collision detection, and goal state recognition.
- Live2D animated characters integrated directly into scenes and subtly respond to player level completion.
- Procedural logic for spawning, rotating, and snapping puzzle tiles into a grid-based layout.
